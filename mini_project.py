# Introduction

# In this project, you will apply your Python programming skills to create a functional To-Do List 
# Application from scratch. The objective of this project is to reinforce your understanding of Python
#  syntax, data types, control structures, functions, and error handling while building a practical 
# and interactive application.

# Project Requirements
# User Interface (UI):
# Create a command-line interface (CLI) for the To-Do List Application.
# Display a welcoming message and a menu with the following options:
# Welcome to the To-Do List App!
#   Menu:
    # 1. Add a task
    # 2. View tasks
    # 3. Mark a task as complete
    # 4. Delete a task
    # 5. Quit

# To-Do List Features:
# Implement the following features for the To-Do List:
# Adding a task (by default “Incomplete”).
# View the list of tasks
# Viewing the list of tasks with their titles and statuses (e.g., "Incomplete" or "Complete"). (BONUS)
# Deleting a task.
# Quitting the application.
# Marking a task as complete. 

# 1.) User Interaction:
# Allow users to interact with the application by selecting menu options using input().
# Implement input validation to handle unexpected user input gracefully.

# 2.) Error Handling:
# Implement error handling using try, except, else, and finally blocks to handle potential issues.

# 3.) Code Organization:
# Organize your code into functions to promote modularity and readability.
# Use meaningful function names with appropriate comments and docstrings for clarity.

# 4.) Testing and Debugging:
# Thoroughly test your application to identify and fix any bugs.
# Consider edge cases, such as empty task lists or incorrect user input.

# 5.) Optional Features (Bonus):
# If you feel adventurous, you can add extra features like task priorities, due dates, 
# or color-coding tasks based on their status.

# 6.) GitHub Repository:
# Create a GitHub repository for your project.
# Commit your code to the repository regularly.
# Include a link to your GitHub repository in your project documentation
